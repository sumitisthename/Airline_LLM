For the Munich to Doha route, usually it is flown by the Boeing 787 or A350-900 which does not have QSuite, but on the day of my travel, we got the 777 with QSuite which was a huge upgrade from these types of planes that usually operate this route. Food was great, Staff was great, Entertainment was Good, WIFI is free for Privilege Club Member up to 1 hour. Arrived in Doha and we enjoy their Al Mourjan Business Lounge located at The Garden. Then we continue to Kuala Lumpur with Malaysia Airlines and the food was terrible, entertainment was very limited, WIFI was slow and staff was not so great.

The check-in process was seamless, and the staff were friendly and efficient. The aircraft was modern and clean, with comfortable seating and ample legroom. The inflight entertainment system was impressive, offering a vast selection of movies, TV shows, and music. The food was delicious, with a variety of options to suit different tastes. What truly impressed me, however, was the exceptional service provided by the cabin crew.

The plane used was old and with a 2-2-2 business class configuration. Less privacy and lack of storage space. The crew made up to the deficit. Lobster meal was very good. The next sector from DOH to IAH was perfect. Business class passengers were given much priority. The in-flight supervisor came to introduce herself to each and every business class passenger. The cabin crew worked tirelessly to serve every request. Wonderful. Qsuites business class is simply amazing. I managed to catch 8 hours of sleep all together. The quality of the food served was top-notched. I tried purchasing the WiFi service but not successful though. Overall, very good quality of production and service. Only grudge is probably the price.

       " 'Review 22: \"we were silver members\" David Sims (Australia) 5th January 2025 I have never felt the need to give Qatar a negative review before. I am a Silver member, and travel exclusively Qatar Airways, and have done for many years but I will start looking at alternatives. My complaints were purely to in respect to the food and the food service. On this occasion it was so bad on both legs of my flight it did really spoil the experience. The plane was lovely, entertainment options good and seating comfortable. I will start with the food service, as a silver member you get a hostess visiting you at the start of the flight and ask you what you would like to eat come meal service, then to be told when the service arrives that that choice has run out. I normally sit with my wife in the central section and I have never fully understood why the food service is not synchronised to start at exactly the same rows on both sides of the plane. I was in seat D and my wife in seat E, the hostess served my meal and moved on. I asked politely if my wife could have her meal and was informed that he was not doing the E seats only the D seat and she would have to wait till the other server arrived, who was about 15 rows forward and nowhere near our seats. I explained that we like to enjoy our wine and meal together at the same time, and that we were silver members and that someone had already taken our orders. He said he was allocated only to the D seats and could not do anything about it. I had finished my meal and had my tray cleared away and was served coffee, my wife still had not recived her meal, or a drink. It was some 45 minutes after I finished my meal that my wife required her meal and this was very disappointing and could have been resolved with flexibility by the staff. Now for the food Choices that consisted of rice with beef, or a chicken sausage wth frittata, and the 3rd which was pasta with a sauce.

For the Munich to Doha route, usually it is flown by the Boeing 787 or A350-900 which does not have QSuite, but on the day of my travel, we got the 777 with QSuite which was a huge upgrade from these types of planes that usually operate this route. Food was great, Staff was great, Entertainment was Good, WIFI is free for Privilege Club Member up to 1 hour. Arrived in Doha and we enjoy their Al Mourjan Business Lounge located at The Garden. Then we continue to Kuala Lumpur with Malaysia Airlines and the food was terrible, entertainment was very limited, WIFI was slow and staff was not so great. Qatar Airways needs to stop handing over their flights to their partners like MH and continue to operate their own daily flights instead.

My complaints were purely to in respect to the food and the food service. On this occasion it was so bad on both legs of my flight it did really spoil the experience. The plane was lovely, entertainment options good and seating comfortable. I will start with the food service, as a silver member you get a hostess visiting you at the start of the flight and ask you what you would like to eat come meal service, then to be told when the service arrives that that choice has run out. I normally sit with my wife in the central section and I have never fully understood why the food service is not synchronised to start at exactly the same rows on both sides of the plane. I was in seat D and my wife in seat E, the hostess served my meal and moved on. I asked politely if my wife could have her meal and was informed that he was not doing the E seats only the D seat and she would have to wait till the other server arrived, who was about 15 rows forward and nowhere near our seats. I explained that we like to enjoy our wine and meal together at the same time, and that we were silver members and that someone had already taken our orders. He said he was allocated only to the D seats and could not do anything about it. I had finished my meal and had my tray cleared away and was served coffee, my wife still had not recived her meal, or a drink.

For the Munich to Doha route, usually it is flown by the Boeing 787 or A350-900 which does not have QSuite, but on the day of my travel, we got the 777 with QSuite which was a huge upgrade from these types of planes that usually operate this route. Food was great, Staff was great, Entertainment was Good, WIFI is free for Privilege Club Member up to 1 hour. Arrived in Doha and we enjoy their Al Mourjan Business Lounge located at The Garden. Then we continue to Kuala Lumpur with Malaysia Airlines and the food was terrible, entertainment was very limited, WIFI was slow and staff was not so great.

The check-in process was seamless, and the staff were friendly and efficient. The aircraft was modern and clean, with comfortable seating and ample legroom. The inflight entertainment system was impressive, offering a vast selection of movies, TV shows, and music. The food was delicious, with a variety of options to suit different tastes. What truly impressed me, however, was the exceptional service provided by the cabin crew. They were attentive, courteous, and went above and beyond to ensure that all passengers had a comfortable and enjoyable flight.

This sector was changed a few months after I booked my ticket, and I didn’t mind so much because I was keen to experience Oman Air. The business class layout is ok, and the seat was very comfortable. There were only 3 passengers travelling in business class on this flight and we were well attended to. The food and wine was good. Nothing more, nothing less. The crew were very pleasant and enjoyed a chat. I find the Qatar entertainment very limited and not a wide selection of movies. The flight itself was very smooth.

The sector from KUL to DOH was not perfect. The plane used was old and with a 2-2-2 business class configuration. Less privacy and lack of storage space. The crew made up to the deficit. Lobster meal was very good. The next sector from DOH to IAH was perfect. Business class passengers were given much priority. The in-flight supervisor came to introduce herself to each and every business class passenger. The cabin crew worked tirelessly to serve every request. Wonderful. Qsuites business class is simply amazing. I managed to catch 8 hours of sleep all together. The quality of the food served was top-notched. I tried purchasing the WiFi service but not successful though. Overall, very good quality of production and service. Only grudge is probably the price. It was much higher than any other airlines.

      "Processing batch ['Review 22: \"we were silver members\" David Sims (Australia) 5th January 2025 I have never felt the need to give Qatar a negative review before. I am a Silver member, and travel exclusively Qatar Airways, and have done for many years but I will start looking at alternatives. My complaints were purely to in respect to the food and the food service. On this occasion it was so bad on both legs of my flight it did really spoil the experience. The plane was lovely, entertainment options good and seating comfortable. I will start with the food service, as a silver member you get a hostess visiting you at the start of the flight and ask you what you would like to eat come meal service, then to be told when the service arrives that that choice has run out. I normally sit with my wife in the central section and I have never fully understood why the food service is not synchronised to start at exactly the same rows on both sides of the plane. I was in seat D and my wife in seat E, the hostess served my meal and moved on. I asked politely if my wife could have her meal and was informed that he was not doing the E seats only the D seat and she would have to wait till the other server arrived, who was about 15 rows forward and nowhere near our seats. I explained that we like to enjoy our wine and meal together at the same time, and that we were silver members and that someone had already taken our orders. He said he was allocated only to the D seats and could not do anything about it. I had finished my meal and had my tray cleared away and was served coffee, my wife still had not recived her meal, or a drink. It was some 45 minutes after I finished my meal that my wife required her meal and this was very disappointing and could have been resolved with flexibility by the staff. Now for the food Choices that consisted of rice with beef, or a chicken sausage wth frittata, and the 3rd which was pasta with a sauce.

For the Munich to Doha route, usually it is flown by the Boeing 787 or A350-900 which does not have QSuite, but on the day of my travel, we got the 777 with QSuite which was a huge upgrade from these types of planes that usually operate this route.

      "**Summary:** The customer, David Sims, a Silver member, experienced poor food service and inconsistent meal delivery on two legs of his flight from Barcelona to Doha. Despite enjoying the plane's comfort, entertainment options, and seating, the subpar food service spoiled his experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Insights:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Inconsistent food service: The customer experienced poor food service, with one hostess serving only one side of the plane, making it difficult for passengers in adjacent seats to receive meals at the same time.\n",
      "* Inflexible staff: The hostess was unwilling to accommodate the customer's request to have his wife's meal served simultaneously, citing that she was only allocated to the D seats.\n",
      "* Disappointing experience: The customer's wife did not receive her meal until 45 minutes after the customer had finished his, which was frustrating and could have been resolved with flexibility by the staff.\n",

The plane used was old and with a 2-2-2 business class configuration. Less privacy and lack of storage space. The crew made up to the deficit. Lobster meal was very good. The next sector from DOH to IAH was perfect. Business class passengers were given much priority. The in-flight supervisor came to introduce herself to each and every business class passenger. The cabin crew worked tirelessly to serve every request. Wonderful. Qsuites business class is simply amazing. I managed to catch 8 hours of sleep all together. The quality of the food served was top-notched. I tried purchasing the WiFi service but not successful though. Overall, very good quality of production and service. Only grudge is probably the price. It was much higher than any other airlines.

       " 'Review 22: \"we were silver members\" David Sims (Australia) 5th January 2025 I have never felt the need to give Qatar a negative review before. I am a Silver member, and travel exclusively Qatar Airways, and have done for many years but I will start looking at alternatives. My complaints were purely to in respect to the food and the food service. On this occasion it was so bad on both legs of my flight it did really spoil the experience. The plane was lovely, entertainment options good and seating comfortable. I will start with the food service, as a silver member you get a hostess visiting you at the start of the flight and ask you what you would like to eat come meal service, then to be told when the service arrives that that choice has run out. I normally sit with my wife in the central section and I have never fully understood why the food service is not synchronised to start at exactly the same rows on both sides of the plane. I was in seat D and my wife in seat E, the hostess served my meal and moved on. I asked politely if my wife could have her meal and was informed that he was not doing the E seats only the D seat and she would have to wait till the other server arrived, who was about 15 rows forward and nowhere near our seats. I explained that we like to enjoy our wine and meal together at the same time, and that we were silver members and that someone had already taken our orders. He said he was allocated only to the D seats and could not do anything about it. I had finished my meal and had my tray cleared away and was served coffee, my wife still had not recived her meal, or a drink. It was some 45 minutes after I finished my meal that my wife required her meal and this was very disappointing and could have been resolved with flexibility by the staff. Now for the food Choices that consisted of rice with beef, or a chicken sausage wth frittata, and the 3rd which was pasta with a sauce.

       "'Review 23: \"the flight with Qatar Airways was great\" L Han (Germany) 5th January 2025 Overall the flight with Qatar Airways itself was great, but the flight with one of its partner Malaysia Airlines to KUL is just terrible. For the Munich to Doha route, usually it is flown by the Boeing 787 or A350-900 which does not have QSuite, but on the day of my travel, we got the 777 with QSuite which was a huge upgrade from these types of planes that usually operate this route. Food was great, Staff was great, Entertainment was Good, WIFI is free for Privilege Club Member up to 1 hour. Arrived in Doha and we enjoy their Al Mourjan Business Lounge located at The Garden. Then we continue to Kuala Lumpur with Malaysia Airlines and the food was terrible, entertainment was very limited, WIFI was slow and staff was not so great. Qatar Airways needs to stop handing over their flights to their partners like MH and continue to operate their own daily flights instead.
