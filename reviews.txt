"a pleasure flying with you" Petrus Smith (South Africa) 30th March 2025 As a regular work-related traveler, the most important thing for me is time when flying - speed at check-ins and flights departing and arriving on time as scheduled. I have been using Qatar Airways for a few years for all my international travel, and I can plan with confidence my onward travel, meetings etc. The onboarding process is seamless, and the ground staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. During flights, the same level of professionalism can be expected, and there are no surprises. I fly the same long-distance route approximately every four weeks, and the experience remains consistent. The food is usually excellent, but on my last trip a few days ago, the Doha-Amman leg, the dinner was exceptional, serving dishes that you do not usually see on flights (to clarify - I flew business class). Thank you, Qatar Airways. It remains a pleasure flying with you.

Review 2:
“still not heard from them for 5 weeks” Ian Goody (United Kingdom) 27th March 2025 Not Verified | My flight from Perth to Heathrow was cancelled at the last minute whilst we were in the departure lounge at midnight. The flight was on July 13th 2024 from Perth Western Australia, due to land at Heathrow Airport London on Sunday afternoon 14th July. Eventually I arrived at Heathrow on Tuesday 16th July at 06:00. I was told that all additional expenses would be refunded. Well, seven months later I am still trying to get a refund. They eventually offered me $250.00 voucher that could only be used with Qatar Airways valid for one year. I declined this offer as the two-night accommodation with meals in Perth city center and vouchers for taxis that I declined as my son was prepared to drive an hour to pick me up at 02:00 in the morning would have cost far more than the voucher they were offering. I was £108.00 out of pocket for my pre-purchased train tickets booked for Sunday 14th and I lost two days of work. Whilst waiting for information on when my newly arranged flight would be leaving, they could not even be bothered to contact me. After an abortive trip to the airport after we found online my boarding pass which had been changed telling me my flight was now at 03:30 Monday morning and a call to Qatar Airlines who told me they did not know, arrived at airport to find out that there was no flight. Their response was oh your contact details is a UK mobile number! As if that made any difference in these circumstances. Eventually after giving the Qatar helpdesk my sons contact details; they informed me they had found a flight from Perth to Doha then to Athens and then finally Heathrow. Then another which was Perth to Doha to Milan to Heathrow. On arrival they told me they had a flight from Perth to Doha and then onto Heathrow. This had a six-hour stopover in Doha. Eventually I arrived home after a nightmare journey at 06:00 on Tuesday morning during rush hour in London. Just the two days late. Despite constant contact with Qatar customer services they just kept telling me that this was their policy and that was the end of the issue. When you do get through you spend another hour telling them that they have all the details. But no, they want to go through it all again. I still have not heard from them for five weeks.

"cabin was unbearably cold" A Jalenad (United States) 21st March 2025 QR 719 from DOH to SEA on 3/21/25. The cabin was unbearably cold, I pushed the call button to request assistance, but no flight attendant responded for over an hour and when someone finally did, they offered no help other than handing me another blanket. This was one of the worst experiences I’ve had. I will be reconsidering future travel with this airline unless they take meaningful steps to improve comfort and responsiveness to passengers.

Review 4:
“could have just let me move" T Reddy (India) 18th March 2025 ✅ Trip | Since 2023, I have consistently avoided flying Qatar Airways because of my sub-par experience in Economy Class. There are only 2 options to Maputo either Qatar Airways or Ethiopian and I decided to go with Qatar. Mumbai to Qatar leg is operated by Indigo which has no IFE and on a 3.5 hour flight, you get a sandwich and a small juice with some crackers and really uncomfortable seats (I admit that was my mistake since I did not check thoroughly). Boarding for the flight to Maputo was chaos by a disorganised gate agent. After departure they served a sandwich, due to the tight connection time, I did not have any time to pick up snacks at the airport. I ended up seated next to a plus sized lady with a rather fussy infant, who had a middle seat. Later, I saw there were quite a few empty seats and they could have just let me move and allowed both of us a bit of comfort, but by the time the seat belt signs were off, others had already spread out and fallen asleep in those seats. The main meal was served 1.5 hours before arrival in Maputo and while the taste was good it was inadequate. My IFE stopped working 5 hours or so into the flight.

Review 5:
“Indigo service not up to expectations” T Reddy (India) 18th March 2025 ✅ Trip Verified I decided to opt for an extra legroom seat up in Economy but the website nor app was allowing me to book the seat or make a payment. I reached out to customer care on email but the agent said that I can book the seat during check-in so to ensure this, I woke up at midnight but the transaction did not go through, the second agent was also equally unhelpful and recommended waiting couple more hours. I stayed awake and tried again but no luck, the third agent then told me that this can be done only before check-in and tried to fob me off with an apology to settle for a seat at airport check-in. Finally the third agent was able to help and I got a good extra legroom seat and thankfully the rest of the journey from Maputo to Doha was great, except for the food quantity which is really not adequate for me. The entertainment selection was not the best but overall this leg was quite comfortable. The crew on-ground and in-air were quite good. The Doha to Bombay leg was less comfortable given that this leg is operated by Indigo. The Indigo service is not up to expectations, there is no IFE, the food offered was a tasteless sandwich and some chips. If you are booking on Qatar Airways to/from India check that the leg from Doha to Qatar is operated by Qatar Airways and not Indigo. I have nothing against Indigo and am perfectly happy to fly them for short domestic flights in India but anything longer than a hour and half with them makes for an uncomfortable flight.

"ruined a checked roller bag" Mike Grandinetti (United States) 15th March 2025 Dammam with a stop in Doha en route to Boston they ruined a checked roller bag of mine. 3 months later, I have yet to get any resolution. They have delayed repeatedly, sending me in an endless circle of unresponsive bureaucracy. I have lost respect for what was once my favorite airline.

Review 10:
"chaotic transfer at Hamad airport" Michael Schade (Thailand) 12th March 2025 Checkin, security and immigration at DXB airport swift, lounge with good a la carte options and friendly service. Boarding well organized. Delayed by 45 minutes due to bad weather. Flight uneventful. Despite delayed arrival, remote stand with bus transfer. It took me 50 minutes from arrival at remote stand till arrival at the terminal. My plan to have a nice breakfast at the lounge was shattered. I had just a 10 minutes at the Platinum/Gold lounge, but left because there was no seat available, no clean cup to make a coffee, and long toilet queues. My flight to Bangkok was a remote stand bus gate. Boarding was poorly organized, as Business class and status guests were asked to wait till Economy has done boarding; the gate agent changed his mind and let C Class and status guests on the bus after 2 bus loads of Y class passengers had gone. It was rather chaotic. The flight on a leased CX aircraft was on time and uneventful. The IFE screens in the bulkhead rows of my section were broken, but large IPads were offered as a replacement, which was great. My food was mediocre. The flights were ok, but the chaotic transfer at Hamad airport left a bitter aftertaste.
